# VMCraft-II
This is the official repository of VMCraft-II, An enterprise virtualization mod for minecraft.

There is a large demand for cybersecurity workers in todayâ€™s economy and world. One reason for this shortage is the lack of interest in younger audiences to cybersecurity. This Minecraft mod creates a platform for students to simulate real-life scenarios from the exciting aspect of a computer game. 

After having improved upon our predecessors who created VMCraft (1), we have created enterprise-virtualization mod that allows users of the mod to create, in minecraft, a computer or laptop (same functionality) block. Once placed, using a configuration key, the user can configure the laptop to connect to an internal or external enterprise server (tested with Proxmox) which hosts virtual machine(s). After configured, the user can then right click on the block and a browser will open. The browser contains a remote desktop GUI for the virtual machine to which you are connecting to.
